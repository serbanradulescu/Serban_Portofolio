### About me:
A data scientist in becoming, specialized in Life Sciences, always looking for new ways to derive meaningful information from data in order to create a more sustainable and equitable future for everyone.



## Python

### [Project 1: Effects of climate change on plant disease enviornmental parameters (Master's Thesis)](https://github.com/serbanradulescu/master_thesis/blob/main/project.ipynb)
<p align="center"> [WORK IN PROGRESS] </p>

* accessing publicly available weather data for Germany (1950 - present) trough an API
* choosing, cleaning, selecting needed datasets
* visualising position of different weather station

To do:
* apply different leaf wetness models on the datasets
* study the disease risk evolution in the last 70 years

### Project 2: Automatizing imports from customers' agricultural enterprise [private repository]
* importing different types of files (shp, csv, iso-xml etc.) and converting them into the internal structure
* improving the internal structure for storing and accessing data
* creating a database and matching imported objects trough feature engineering
* keeping the database up to date while improving the matching efficacy

### [Project 3: To be added](www.notyet.com)
* web scraping project, will be added soon

<br />

## R

### Project 4: Replicating the results of a published research (University project)

* replicating the results of: [Effects of chronic exposure to thiamethoxam on larvae of the hoverfly *Eristalis tenax (Diptera, Syrphidae)*](https://peerj.com/articles/4258/) - a study on the effect of insecticides on pollinators
* project made in collaboration with 3 classmates from PlantHealth Master's program
* statistical methods applied: ANOVA, Shapiro, Kruskal-Wallis
* visualisation methods: Kaplan-Meier curves, elipses, Heatmap , Correlation circle

Fig. 2.3: Correlation circle between the 7 different behaviours. Variables grouped together are corelated, while the arrows closer to the circle are better explained by the two dimensions of the PCA. (F,W correlated; S, GR correlated; M-PR negatively correlated but PR is not well explained by the two dimensions)
Keys: S - stationary, GR - grooming, W - walking, F - flying, PR - probing, N - feeding(nutrition), M - moving

### Areas of improvements

<details><summary>Click for details</summary>  
   
It takes a lot of strength to admit your weaknesses. However, admitting your shortcomings is the first step to self-improvement.
 
* technical
  * take more advantage of python packages
  * improve git commit etiquette
  * better markdown skills ( this pages serves as an example )

* soft-skills
  * presenting progress to non-technical stakeholders
  * delegating tasks to people
